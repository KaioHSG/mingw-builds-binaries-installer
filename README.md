# MinGW-w64 Binaries

MinGW-w64 compiler binaries.

Download a [build](https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds-binaries/releases/latest) or use the [installer](https://github.com/KaioHSG/mingw-builds-binaries-installer/archive/refs/heads/installer.zip) ([VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4020622307428badcbc28bc3a991c77341b08844f363f9a3232c312d232a2f7d)).

The installer provides options to select the build parameters you need, then downloads and extracts the files to the selected directory. If there is no internet connection, it will install the latest downloaded version.
It also creates an environment variable for the path to the binaries (including local installations).
And now you can use the `update-mingw` command to check for updates.
